    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function of the problem will be to minimize the miles driven between\n",
    "brooders and finishers over one year\n",
    "Before constraints can be written, a proper understanding of the turkey growing operation\n",
    "must be acquired. The birds (called “poults” at this point in their life) are purchased and\n",
    "delivered at one day old from nearby hatcheries and spend roughly the first 35 days of their lives\n",
    "living in barns called brooders. A brooder can typically hold anywhere between 100,000 and\n",
    "170,000 poults. After 35 days have elapsed and the poults have nearly outgrown the brooder barn\n",
    "they are transported on trucks (approximately 3,000 at a time) to farms called finishers. A\n",
    "finisher is comprised of two to five barns with each barn having a capacity of 11,000 birds. After\n",
    "brooder barns are emptied they are cleaned and the bedding (of sawdust) is changed; this process\n",
    "typically takes about 19 days. Once birds have been emptied into a finisher they grow for an\n",
    "additional 105 days before being loading onto trucks and are taken to the plant. After a finisher is\n",
    "emptied it is cleaned over a period of roughly 20 days and prepared for the next flock of birds.\n",
    "Several years ago there was an international pandemic of avian flu which culled the birds\n",
    "of many poultry operations in the region and around the world. Since that avian flu outbreak\n",
    "poultry growers have enacted strict biosecurity measures to ensure the health and quality of their\n",
    "birds. One such measure is to mandate that no birds of different age groups are mixed together.\n",
    "For practical purposes, “same age” is taken to mean that they are born within one week apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of factors which might be relevant in the “real world” but cannot be\n",
    "considered in this model due the difficulty involved in representing them mathematically. Some\n",
    "of these factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bird mortality: typically mortality is roughly 3% in brooders and 12% in finishers. Bird\n",
    "mortality could be described as stochastic and is dependent on travel time, weather, bird\n",
    "stress, and overall bird health\n",
    "\n",
    "- Birds of the same age in different brooders: if birds of the same age are raised in different\n",
    "brooders it is permissible for them to be placed at the same finisher\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inexactness of capacity: while brooders and finishers have certain capacities it is unusual\n",
    "for them to contain that exact amount of birds. For example, sometimes a finisher barn\n",
    "may be slightly overfilled with 11,500 birds or underfilled with only 10,000 birds.\n",
    "Additionally, sometimes brooders will contain fewer than their capacity allows due to\n",
    "mortality or the hatchery slightly underdelivering on an order\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inexactness of growing and cleaning times: often birds may stay in a brooder or finisher\n",
    "for longer than 35 or 105 days. For example, if the processing facility is unable to keep\n",
    "up with the production schedule (which was determine 1-2 years in advance) due to\n",
    "insufficient labor, birds may end up staying in a finisher for an additional 30 days or\n",
    "more. Additionally, a farmer may take shorter or longer than 19 or 20 days to clean their\n",
    "barn after it is emptied\n",
    "\n",
    "While important to consider, these points will not be factored into this particular model\n",
    "formulation. However, should the company wish to run a full-scale model if this preliminary one\n",
    "proves successful some of these may be wise to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this model there are three main types of constraints and\n",
    "considerations:\n",
    "- Turkey life cycle\n",
    "  - Brooders\n",
    "    - Each brooder is occupied for 35 days prior to being emptied\n",
    "    - Each brooder is cleaned over a period of 19 days after it is emptied\n",
    "    - Therefore, it could be said that the average brooder is emptied (365/54) = 6.759 times per year\n",
    "  - Finishers\n",
    "    - Each finisher is occupied for 105 days prior to being emptied\n",
    "    - Each finisher is cleaned over a period of 20 days after it is emptied\n",
    "    - Therefore, it could be said that the average finisher receives (365/125) = 2.92 flocks of birds from brooders per year\n",
    "- Farm and truck capacity\n",
    "  - Brooders\n",
    "    - Each brooder has a certain capacity of between 110,000 and 170,000\n",
    "    - All brooders must be completely emptied after 35 days\n",
    "  - Finishers\n",
    "    - Each finisher may contain anywhere between 2 and 5 barns\n",
    "    - Each barn has a capacity of 11,000 birds\n",
    "    - Therefore, each finisher (farm) has a capacity of 22,000, 33,000, 44,000, or 55,000\n",
    "    - The capacity of birds a finisher/ a group of finishers may receive from any given brooder over a year must be equal to or exceed the amount of birds that are actually sent to it\n",
    "  - Trucks\n",
    "    - Each truck can carry only 3,000 birds at a time\n",
    "    - Therefore, the number of truckloads required to transport birds from brooders to finishers are 8, 11, 15, and 19 for finishers of capacity 22,000, 33,000, 44,000, 55,000 respectively (truckloads are rounded up because there can be no fraction of a load)\n",
    "- Biosecurity\n",
    "  - Birds may only be in the same brooder or finisher if they are born no more than a week apart\n",
    "  - (For this scaled-down problem) Each finisher may be assigned only one brooder. i.e. even if birds in different brooders are of the same age they still cannot be grouped together in the same finisher"
